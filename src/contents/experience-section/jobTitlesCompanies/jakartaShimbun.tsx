        <p className="lg:text-2xl mt-5">At Jakarta Shimbun, as a marketing staff, I was trusted with mostly customer-relationship and advertising matters
        During the employment period, I was able to secure around 50 long-term advertising contracts,
        and 75 short-term contracts. I was also able to retain new 40 clients. 
        Due to the nature of the workplace that had around 40% Japanese people and,
        the clients being mostly Japanese, I managed to gain the ability to speak Japanese in business manner. 
        This helped me to my next employment opportunity that was in Japan.
